# Customer-Segmentation

**Problem Statement:**

Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves a number of business clients (e.g., retailers, restaurants, hotels, or cafes) in Portugal. The management
of XYZ would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of their clients, so that they can make strategic decisions to better meet the clients' demand (e.g., to improve inventory management and avoid shortages). We need to analyze 440 clients and their annual spending (in a standardized monetary unit). 

**Data Description:**

Each record corresponds to a client, and contains a client's region, channel, as well as the client's annual spending across 6 product categories.
